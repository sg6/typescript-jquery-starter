# TypeScript jQuery Starter Project

This projects is an example of how to use a simple jQuery app with TypeScript.  
Aside of TypeScript and jQuery we use vite for bundling and make the app working for browsers.

This project is backend friendly, which means it is configured to be used everywhere, not only for frontend-focused applications.

## Structure

- The app.ts is the entry point of the application.
- the src directory contains the app itself
- the src/app contains the app logic
- the src/app/vote contains an example of how to use classes in TypeScript

# Warning

This project is far from perfect and of course not the only possible solution.
It should just give an idea, how easy it is to write even extremely small apps in TypeScript.

# Let's Get Ready

Run `yarn` (or `npm i`)

When the packages are installed, run `yarn start` (or `npm start`)

--> Go to http://localhost:8080

## Write Code

Whenever you extend / edit your application, webpack will create a new index.js file - just reload your browser on localhost:8080 to see the new functionality or check the console for errors.
